        <h1>This Site is a List of Echo's Commands, Sorted By The Type of Command</h1>
          <p>Echo is designed to pick up on commands by finding keywords within the message. He will not, however, carry out a command unless called upon.</p>
          <p>To call upon Echo, you can use practically any manner of addressing him, be it by saying his name, mentioning him, or even delivering the command within a private message to Echo.</p>
          <p>If you are in a rush, you may choose to call upon him by including a backslash (/) followed by the letter E, and then using any of the keywords of his various commands.</p>
