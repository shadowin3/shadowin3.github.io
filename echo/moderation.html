        <h1>Moderation Commands:</h1>
          <h2>Message Deletion</h2>
            <p>Keywords: Clear, Clean, Purge, Prune, Delete</p>
            <p>Ex: Echo, delete 5 messages from this channel.</p>
          <h2>Kicking Members</h2>
            <p>Keyword: Kick</p>
            <p>Note: This requires you to mention the member that you wish to kick, as users can only be kicked from a server through their ID.</p>
            <p>Ex: Echo, kick @JohnSmith#1234</p>
          <h2>Banning Members</h2>
            <p>Keyword: Ban</p>
            <p>Note: This requires you to mention the member that you wish to ban, as discord only allows users to be banned from a server through their ID.</p>
            <p>Ex: Echo, ban @JohnSmith#1234</p>
          <h2>Unbanning Members</p>
            <p>Keyword: Unban</p>
            <p>Note: This requires you to give the user ID of the banned member, as you cannot mention someone who is not currently in your server. In order to find any user's ID, simply right click on their private message tab and click on the option that says: "copy ID."</p>
            <p>Ex: Echo, unban 123456789012345678</p>
          <h2>Muting Members</h2>
            <p>Keyword: Mute</p>
            <p>Note: This requires you to mention the member that you wish to mute, as Echo can only add the mute role to members through their ID.</p>
            <p>Ex: Echo, mute @JohnSmith#1234</p>
          <h2>Unmuting Members</h2>
            <p>Keyword: Unmute</p>
            <p>Note: This requires you to mention the member that you wish to unmute, as the mute role can only be removed from users via their ID.</p>
            <p>Ex: Echo, unmute @JohnSmith#1234</p>
        <h1>IMPORTANT NOTE: As a precaution against abusing Echo to bypass permissions, ALL moderation commands can only be used by those who have specific permission to perform the tasks themselves within the server.</h1>
